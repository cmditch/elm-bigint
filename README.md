# bigint

Elm's native integer type uses raw JavaScript integers which are limited in size ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)). Sometimes, we want more.

This package provides a `BigInt` type and associated functions so that you can work with integers of unlimited size at the cost of some speed. Benchmarks included.
